      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This greasy, cheesy, slightly spicy dip may only be edible for one day out of the year, but can make the super bowl watchable.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 whole rotisserie chicken</li>
          <li>1 cup of Frank's RedHot or other desired sauce.</li>
          <li>16 oz cream cheese</li>
          <li>1 cup ranch <em>or</em> 1/2 cup ranch and 1/2 cup blue cheese</li>
          <li>1/2 cup green onion</li>
          <li>1/2 yellow onion</li>
          <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
          <li>Crackers</li>
          <li>1 cup shredded cheddar</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Begin carving up rotisserie chicken. Share wings and drumsticks with party or yourself to satiate desires.</li>
          <li>Chop 1/2 yellow onion to small dices.</li>
          <li>Sweat onions in large cast iron skillet on medium heat with butter. Add in chicken and hot sauce. Stir. <strong>Note</strong>: It is a good idea that the cream cheese is softened before next step.</li>
          <li>Add in cream cheese and stir. Add ranch and optional blue cheese. Mix well.</li>
          <li>Once ingredients have had a chance to get to know eachother, top with cheddar. Transfer skillet to oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Allow 30-40 minutes for cheese to crisp.</li>
          <li>Take skillet out of oven and rest for at least 3 minutes. Top with green onion and serve with crackers of choice.</li>   
        </ol>
